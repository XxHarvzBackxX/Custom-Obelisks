# Custom Obelisks
A framework that allows you to add your own custom warp obelisks to the Wizard's construction menu, as well as custom totems and warp sceptres.

Via content packs, you can now create your own warp obelisks, totems, and sceptres! Be that to a vanilla location, or a modded one, the possibilities are endless!
